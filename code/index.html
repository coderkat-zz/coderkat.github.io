<h1>Code Monkey</h1>

<p>In the winter of 2013, I started to learn to code and it has changed my life in so many ways. I loved it so much I enrolled in  <a href="https://hackbrightacademy.com/">Hackbright Academy</a> the spring of that year, and after a very intense 12 weeks, entered the workforce as a software developer.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve since had the pleasure to work as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/">Eventbrite</a> for two years, followed by a year at the now-extinct <a href="http://longlivelovely.com/">Lovely</a> as a developer and engineering manager. I am so grateful for the mentorship and growth I found at both of these companies.</p>

<p>I&#39;m now in the midst of a year of being (more or less) a vagabond: a few months in Portland led to a summer in my hometown of Chicago, and I&#39;vehave the pleasure to spend this fall living in Southeast Asia. I have a few projects brewing, and am excited to share them in this space when they&#39;re ready!</p>

<p>Oh yeah, I&#39;m also on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/coderkat">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
