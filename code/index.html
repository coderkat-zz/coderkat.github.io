<h1>Code Monkey</h1>

<p>I&#39;ve been known to write code.</p>

<p>You can check out my Github account, which will hopefully become less dismal in the near future as I spend some of my time this year working on personal projects that aren&#39;t hidden behind corporate walls! (Most of what you&#39;ll find there right now are projects that make me grimace from my very early learning-to-code days and time spent at <a href="https://hackbrightacademy.com/">Hackbright Academy</a> in the spring of 2013.) But hey! If I didn&#39;t hate code I wrote 4 years ago, I wouldn&#39;t have learned anything since, right?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve since had the pleasure to work as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/">Eventbrite</a> for two years, followed by a year at the now-extinct <a href="http://longlivelovely.com/">Lovely</a> as a developer and engineering manager. I am so grateful for the mentorship and growth I found at both of these companies.</p>

<p>I&#39;m now in the midst of a year of being (more or less) a vagabond: a few months in Portland led to a summer in my hometown of Chicago, and I&#39;ll have the pleasure to spend this fall living in Southeast Asia. I have a few projects brewing, and am excited to share them in this space when they&#39;re ready!</p>

<p>Oh yeah, I&#39;m also on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/coderkat">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
