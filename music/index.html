<h2>Hi! At times, I'm a musician!</h2>

<p>A trumpet player, vocalist, and fledgling guitar player, I've been making music on and off about as long as I can remember. I lean towards trad jazz and folk-inspired music, but have played in symphonies and soul bands. I love it all.</p>

<p>While in San Francisco, I had the pleasure to work with some swell pals on a little band formerly known as the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hickorystreetjazz/">Hickory Street Jazz Club</a>, and I'm thrilled to find friends to play and sing with as I spend this year as a vagabond.</p>

<p>You can check out some stuff I've worked on on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/kat_king">Soundcloud</a>!</p>
